# SMART-RESTURANT-SYSTEM
The art of technology from reservation to ordering and storing customer records is the concept of Smart restaurant. The project mainly aims in designing completely automated menu and delivery of order to the customer table in restaurants with the help of Android mobile phone application or through website and conveyor belts. There is no need of a person to take the order from the table. The menu will be displayed on the customer mobile application and they can directly order from the displayed menu. The system calculates and displays the final bill based on the placed order. Efficient and low-cost design methodology. Smart Restaurant is developed to provide an easy interaction between the customers through wireless technology.
